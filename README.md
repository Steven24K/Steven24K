## About me 

My name is Steven and in 2020 I graduated from my bachelors degree in computer science at the Rotterdam university (Hogeschool Rotterdam). 
At the moment I am working at Hoppinger, buidling websites with C#(ASP.NET), React, Typescript and headless CMS's (Wordpress, Sharepoint and Drupal). 
I am always find it a challenge to build a website on a budget, look at my portfolio website for instance. It is hosted for free on Github pages, with help of Gatsby. The content is fully managed from a GitHub repository. To read more about me find the website [here](https://stevenkoerts.nl). 

## Current projects 

Right now I am trying to automate the proces of building a database managment system. The project is called CodeGenPHP. It is a code generator written in Typescript, wich should output a fully functional website with an admin panel where you can manage the tables. The input specified will be an entity relational model.
